## Welcome to CRISP

CRISP is a multi-faceted project to study extinction towards supernovae and their environments though a variety of observational techniques including photometry,integral field spectroscopy and polarimetry of both SNe and their hosts, machine learning tools and theoretical

### Projects

- [Impact of varying colour-luminosity relation in type Ia supernova cosmology](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200913230G/abstract) (PI: González-Gaitán):
Type Ia supernova (SN) cosmology has been essential in determining the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, the standardization of their luminosity to measure distances relies on a color-luminosity calibration that generally assumes a constant factor throughout the SN Ia population. We investigate in this project the effect of letting this parameter vary.
